### What's this course about?

Learn React or dive deeper into it. Learn the theory, solve assignments, practice in demo projects and build one big application which is improved throughout the course: The Burger Builder!

### More details please!

JavaScript is the major driver of modern web applications since it's the only programming language which runs in the browser and hence allows you to provide highly reactive apps. You'll be able to achieve mobile-app like user experiences in the web.

But using JavaScript can be challenging - it quickly becomes overwhelming to create a nice web app with vanilla JavaScript and jQuery only.

React to the rescue! 

React is all about components - basically custom HTML elements - with which you can quickly build amazing and powerful web apps. Just build a component once, configure it to your needs, dynamically pass data into it (or listen to your own events!) and re-use it as often as needed.

Need to display a list of users in your app? It's as simple as creating a "User" component and outputting it as often as needed.

This course will start at the very basics and explain what exactly React is and how you may use it (and for which kind of apps). Thereafter, we'll go all the way from basic to advanced. We'll not just scratch the surface but dive deeply into React as well as popular libraries like react-router and Redux. 

By the end of the course, you can build amazing React (single page) applications!

A detailed list with the course content can be found below.

## Who's teaching you in this course?

My name is Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller, I'm a freelance web developer and worked with React in many projects. I'm also a 5-star rated instructor here on Udemy. I cover React's most popular alternatives - Vue and Angular - as well as many other topics. I know what I'm talking about and I know where the pain points can be found.

It's my goal to get you started with React as quick as possible and ensure your success. But I don't just focus on students getting started. I want everyone to benefit from my courses, that's why we'll dive deeply into React and why I made sure to also share knowledge that's helpful to advanced React developers. 

## Is this course for you?

This course is for you if ...

...you're just getting started with frontend/ JavaScript development and only got the JS basics set (no prior React or other framework experience is required!)

...you're experienced with Angular or Vue but want to dive into React

...know the React basics but want to refresh them and/ or dive deeper

...already worked quite a bit with React but want to dive deeper and see it all come together in a bigger app

## What should you bring to succeed in that course?

HTML + CSS + JavaScript knowledge is required. You don't need to be an expert but the basics need to be set

NO advanced JavaScript knowledge is required, though you'll be able to move even quicker through the course if you know next-gen JavaScript features like ES6 Arrow functions. A short refresher about the most important next-gen features is provided in the course though.
